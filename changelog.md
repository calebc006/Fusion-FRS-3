# FRS 3 Changelog

## v3.0 (Released 110226)
- Massively improved back-end performance and reliability via code optimizations. Eliminated previous issues of lag, crashing and instability.
- Added optional input configuration for users: description, table number (for new seating feature), sorting index (for priority of display), filter tag(s).
- Introduced InteractiveFR, using a similar backend as SimpliFRy.
- Deployed for 29th SMEAC @ SAFTI MI and 2026 SSPP @ JPJC.

## v3.1 (CAA 170226)
### InteractiveFR
- [x] Refactored backend to use dependency injection. Separated `VideoPlayer` and `FREngine` classes
- [x] Distinguished input resolution from inference resolution. Improved default quality and resolution of stream. Can be configured from frontend and environment.
- [x] Switched to non-square model input (640x480 default) 
- [x] Removed hold_time from the backend. Switched to using a queue with max-length for old_detections.
- [x] Catch and warn user when capturing with an existing name. Confirmation required via separate API path.
- [x] UI changes: Enlarged video feed, improved capture/remove image toasts, changed bbox labels (only display for target and identified faces), added settings submit toast, capture on "ENTER"
- [x] Convert buffer to `np.ndarray` before storing in `VideoPlayer`
- [x] Factor out Voyager index to separate `EmbeddingIndex` class from `FREngine`
- [x] Improve backend perf-logging, expose to frontend
- [ ] Reliability and performance testing
- [ ] Update docs and developer guide

### SimpliFRy
- [x] Reuse similar backend to InteractiveFR
- [x] Port over UI changes, rework init page logic, implement holding_time
- [ ] Port over perf log
- [ ] Reliability and performance testing
- [ ] Update docs
- [ ] ibpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile (during png decode)

### Gotendance
- [ ] Confirm that we aren't dropping any detections, even with high update interval
- [ ] Auto import namelist file, use full path
- [ ] Manual marking overrules automatic detection
- [ ] Update docs

## Future
- [ ] Two separate FFMPEG processes for RAW and MJPEG streams
- [ ] Lazy loading for reference images
- [ ] Implement TLS (https) for safer multi-location implementation
