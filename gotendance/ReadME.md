## Overview

**Gotendance** is an attendance tracking app designed to work with [**simpliFRy**](../simpliFRy/) for automated facial recognition attendance taking. Built primarily with **Go** and a vanilla **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** web interface, it is lightweight, portable, and easy to deploy without requiring complex runtime dependencies.

The application listens to real-time result streams (such as facial recognition data) and automatically updates attendance records, while also allowing manual attendance management through a clean web interface.

**Technology Stack:**
- Backend: Go (Golang)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript
- No external runtime dependencies (Node.js, etc.) required

---

## Key Features

### 🚀 Easy Installation and Deployment

Golang programs compile to a single binary executable, and the vanilla JavaScript UI runs in any modern browser without needing Node.js or other JavaScript runtimes. Once built, the application can be distributed by simply copying:
- The executable file (`gotendance.exe`)
- The `templates` folder
- The `static` folder

No installation process is needed on the target machine.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version 1.16 or later)

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CJBuzz/Real-time-FRS-2.0.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the gotendance directory:
   ```bash
   cd gotendance
   ```

3. Build the executable:
   ```bash
   go build
   ```

This will generate a `gotendance.exe` file (on Windows) or `gotendance` binary (on Linux/Mac).

### Distribution

Once built, the application can be distributed as a self-contained package. Copy these items together:

```
folder/
├── static/          # CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets
├── templates/       # HTML templates for the web interface
└── gotendance.exe   # The compiled executable
```

Ensure all three components remain in the same directory. The application will run on any machine without requiring Go to be installed.

---

## How to Use

### Starting the Application

1. Run the executable:
   - **Windows**: Double-click `gotendance.exe`
   - **Linux/Mac**: Run `./gotendance` in terminal

2. The server will start on port 1500

3. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:1500
   ```
   or
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:1500
   ```

   > **Recommended browser**: Chromium-based browser

### Loading Personnel Data

![Home Page](assets/main_page.png)

1. On the home page, locate the **Load Personnel List** section

2. Prepare a JSON file with the personnel list in the following format:
   ```json
   {
      "details": [
         {
               "name": "John Doe",
               "tags": ["Army", "DIS"], // optional
         },
         {
               "name": "3SG CALEB CHIA",
               "tags": ["Air Force"], // optional
         }
      ]
   }
   ```
   
   A sample file is provided at `assets/test.json`. For more details on data preparation, see the [simpliFRy data preparation guide](../simpliFRy/ReadME.md#data-preparation). The same JSON file can be used for SimpliFRy and Gotendance!

3. Click the file input, select your JSON file, and click the upload icon

4. The personnel list will be loaded into the system

### Connecting Result Streams

Gotendance listens to HTTP streaming responses from services like simpliFRy to automatically update attendance records.

1. **Ensure your result stream service is running** (e.g., simpliFRy)

2. In the **FR Results Stream URL** section, enter the stream URL:
   - For simpliFRy: `http://<IP>:<PORT>/api/frResults`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:5000/api/frResults`
   
   The stream should provide data in this format:
   ```json
   {
     "data": [
       {"label": "John Doe"},
       {"label": "Jane Smith"}
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Set the **Update Interval** (in seconds):
   - This controls how often gotendance processes the incoming stream. 
   - Lower values = more frequent updates

4. Click **Submit** to add the stream

5. **Managing streams**:
   - Successfully added streams appear under **Results Stream** section
   - Multiple streams can be added and will be processed concurrently
   - To remove a stream, click the remove button next to its URL
   - Gotendance will immediately stop listening to removed streams

### Viewing and Managing Attendance

![Records Page](assets/records.png)

1. Navigate to the records page:
   ```
   http://localhost:1500/records
   ```

2. **Understanding the display**:
   - Names with a ✓ checkmark have been detected by the recognition system
   - The checkbox icon shows the current attendance status

3. **Manual attendance management**:
   - Click any checkbox to toggle between Present/Absent
   - This allows manual overrides when needed (e.g., for technical issues or special cases)

4. **Resetting attendance**:
   - Use the reset function on the home page to clear all attendance records
   - Useful for starting a new session or event

5. **Exporting data**:
   - Attendance records are automatically saved to `output.json`
   - Records persist across application restarts
