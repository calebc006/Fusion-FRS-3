# Real-time Facial Recognition System 3

<img src="assets/fusionlogo.png" width="200" alt="Project Logo" />


## Description

This repository contains all the source code for Fusion FRS 3 (initially released Feb 2026). 

FRS 3 is a web application for real-time facial recognition, used for attendance taking during events and army/unit showcases.

`/simplifry` contains the core FRS software used for deployment. **SimpliFRy** is a locally-hosted web application built using Python 3.10 and [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask). It makes use of the [`buffalo_l`](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/blob/master/python-package/README.md#model-zoo) model by [InsightFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) for face detection and generation of embeddings as well as Spotify's [Voyager](https://github.com/spotify/voyager) for approximate-nearest-neighbor search.

`/gotendance` is the companion to **SimpliFRy**. It is a lightweight attendance-tracking application built in Go that processes real-time results from SimpliFRy for automated attendance taking.

## Features

As compared to previous iterations, **FRS 3** has the following key improvements:

- Massively improved back-end performance and reliability via code optimizations. Eliminated previous issues of lag, crashing and instability.
- Added optional input configuration for users: description, table number (for new seating feature), sorting index (for priority of display), filter tag(s).
- Lightweight, containerized deployment with Docker Compose.
- Easy integration between SimpliFRy (recognition) and Gotendance (attendance tracking).

For a detailed list of changes, refer to the [changelog](./changelog.md).

## Installation & Setup (SimpliFRy + Gotendance)

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Nvidia Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) (for GPU support in Docker)
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for local development without Docker)
- [Go 1.23.0+](https://go.dev/doc/install) (for building Gotendance locally)
- [FFmpeg 8.0.1+ ](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) 

### Quick Start with Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/calebc006/Fusion-FRS-3.git
   cd Fusion-FRS-3
   ```

2. Build the Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker compose build
   ```

3. Start both services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

4. Access the applications:
   - **SimpliFRy**: http://localhost:1333
   - **Gotendance**: http://localhost:1500

### Docker Desktop View:

![alt text](./assets/docker.png)
Check that both containers are running! The containers can also be started from the Docker Desktop app.

### Local Development Setup

**SimpliFRy:**
```bash
cd simpliFRy
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# Access at http://localhost:1333
```

**Gotendance:**
```bash
cd gotendance
go build
./gotendance.exe  # On Linux/macOS: ./gotendance
# Access at http://localhost:1500
```

---

## Usage


Once both containers are running,

#### SimpliFRy (Port 1333)
1. Open http://localhost:1333 in your browser
2. Load a personnel JSON file (see [Data Preparation](#data-preparation))
3. Follow instructions on the UI to connect to a video stream
4. Begin facial recognition!

#### Gotendance (Port 1500)
1. Open http://localhost:1500 in your browser
2. Load the same personnel dataset
3. Connect to SimpliFRy's result stream:
   - **URL**: `http://<my.ip.address>:1333/api/frResults`
   - Multiple result streams can be connected to Gotendance.
4. Gotendance will automatically track attendance based on detections from the connected SimpliFRy result streams

#### Connecting Services

Multiple instances of SimpliFRy (running of different computers) can be connected to the same instance of Gotendance, for centralized attendance tracking. 

| Scenario | URL to use in Gotendance |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Both in Docker on the same machine | `http://simplifry:1333/api/frResults` OR `http://<host.ip.address>:1333/api/frResults` |
| SimpliFRy on external machine | `http://<external.ip.address>:1333/api/frResults` |

## Data Preparation

To set up facial recognition, you need to prepare a JSON file mapping images to people. In the `simpliFRy/data` folder, 

1. Create a new folder (any name) containing all the images.
2. Create a JSON file (any name) that maps images to people (more details below).

### Example Directory Structure

```
simpliFRy/
├── data/
│   ├── logs/              # Auto-generated logs
│   ├── flags/             # Optional: flag images
│   ├── pictures/          # Your reference images
│   │   ├── john_doe1.jpg
│   │   ├── john_doe2.png
│   │   └── caleb.png
│   └── namelist.json      # Personnel mapping file
└── other files
```

### JSON Format
**Minimal format (required):**
```json
{
    "img_folder_path": "pictures",
    "details": [
        {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "images": ["john_doe1.jpg", "john_doe2.png"]
        },
        {
            "name": "3SG CALEB CHIA",
            "images": ["caleb.png"]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Extended format (optional features):**
```json
{
    "img_folder_path": "pictures",
    "flag_folder_path": "flags",
    "details": [
        {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "images": ["john_doe1.jpg", "john_doe2.png"],
            "description": "someone",
            "country_flag": "singapore_flag.png",
            "table": "T1",
            "tags": ["Army", "DIS"],
            "priority": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Description | Required? |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------|-------|
|`img_folder_path`| String | The path to the folder with all the user images relative to `/data`| Y |
|`flag_folder_path`| String | The path to the folder with all the country flags relative to `/data`| N |
|`name`| String | The display name of the user (must be unique!) | Y |
|`images`| List[String] | List of image names within `img_folder_path`| Y |
|`description`| List[String] | Optional description to be displayed alongside `name` | N |
|`country_flag`| String | Image name for the flag to be displayed on `/welcome` page | N |
|`table`| String | The table name that is used for the `/seats` table lighting functionality | N |
|`tags`| List[String] | Optional list of filter tags used in Gotendance | N |
|`priority`| Integer | Determines the sorting order in detection lists (lower number = shown first). If two people have the same priority or no priority is set, they are sorted alphabetically | N |

### Loading Data

1. **Via SimpliFRy UI**: Upload JSON file in settings page
2. **Via Gotendance UI**: Upload the same JSON file in home page
3. Both services use the same format, so you only need one JSON file
