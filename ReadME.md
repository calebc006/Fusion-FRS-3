# Real-time Facial Recognition System 3

## Description

This repository contains all the source code for Fusion FRS 3 (initially released Feb 2026). 

FRS 3 is a web application for real-time facial recognition. Used for attendance taking for events and army/unit showcases.

`/simplifry` contains the core FRS software used for deployment. **SimpliFRy** is a locally-hosted web application built using python 3.10 and [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask). It makes use of the [`buffalo_l`](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/blob/master/python-package/README.md#model-zoo) model by [InsightFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) for face detection and generation of embeddings, while Spotify's [Voyager](https://github.com/spotify/voyager) is used for approximate-nearest-neighbor search. 

`/gotendance` is the companion to **SimpliFRy**. It is an attendance-tracking app, intended as a companion to simpliFRy for attendance taking. 

`/interactiveFR` is a showcase version of FRS. Much of the backend is similar to **SimpliFRy**, but it allows users to capture their faces and add themselves to the database while the app is running.

For more technical details, refer to the [Developer Guide](./Developer%20Guide.md)

We acknowledge the past versions of FRS, built by our seniors in Fusion Coy; much in this project is owed to their efforts. (unfortunately some of these links are now inactive)

- v2.1: https://github.com/plainpotato/FR-FUSION
- v2.0: https://github.com/CJBuzz/Real-time-FRS-2.0
- v1.0: https://github.com/CJBuzz/FRS

## New Features

As compared to previous iterations, **FRS 3** has the following key improvements:

- Massively improved back-end performance and reliability via code optimizations. Eliminated previous issues of lag, crashing and instability.
- Added optional input configuration for users: description, table number (for new seating feature), sorting index (for priority of display), filter tag(s).
- Introduced InteractiveFR, using a similar backend as SimpliFRy.

For a detailed list of changes, refer to [changelog.md](./changelog.md)

## Recommended HIKVISION Camera Settings

In Fusion Company, we typically use HIKVISION IP cameras to provide RTSP input during deployment. As of Feb 2026, we use the HIKVISION iDS-2CD7A46G0-IZHS. 

Video settings can be adjusted in the HIKVISION Video Management Software. These are the typical settings we use, to balance low-latency and acceptable video quality.

Image settings can also be changed to adjust exposure, contrast, dynamic range and more. These should be tuned to ensure a clear image given the lighting conditions of the deployment site.
